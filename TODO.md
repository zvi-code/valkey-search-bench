**Benefits:** Ensures more accurate benchmark results by avoiding the influence of lagging replicas and providing clearer insights into cluster health.

### 28. Implement vec-scan-q-verify
**Status:** Planned
**Description:** Implement a new operation type `vec-scan-q-verify` that performs vector scan queries and verifies the results against self. This can be used for datasets without ground truth. We can generate "statistical" recall calculations when looking on aggregate queries. How many top-k (k=1) we got out on N queries.
**Benefits:** Some sanity test of quality, without the cost of ground truth generation.

### 29. Embed ef-construction and m setting in the index name
**Status:** Planned
**Description:** Modify the index naming convention to include `ef-construction` and `m` parameters directly in the index name. This will help in easily identifying the configuration of each index based on its name.  
**Benefits:** Simplifies index management and identification, especially when dealing with multiple indexes with different configurations

### 30. Deduce vector-field-name from the dataset name. 
**Status:** Planned
**Description:** Implement a mechanism to automatically deduce the vector field name from the dataset name during index creation. This will streamline the process of setting up indexes by reducing the need for manual configuration.
**Benefits:** Enhances usability and reduces configuration errors by automating the mapping between datasets and their corresponding vector fields.

### 31. Vector load progress reporting

## Search Quality Metrics Enhancements
### Add additional search results quality metrics
**Status:** Planned
**Description:** Implement additional metrics to evaluate the quality of search results beyond simple recall. These metrics provide deeper insights into ranking quality and relevance ordering:

#### 🧮 1. **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**

**Definition:**
For each query, compute the *average precision* (AP), which takes into account the *rank positions* of the correct items. Then take the mean across queries.

```
AP = (1 / N_relevant) * Σ(k=1 to K) P@k · rel(k)
```

where `P@k` is the precision at rank `k`, and `rel(k)` is 1 if the item at rank `k` is relevant.

MAP rewards algorithms that return correct items early in the ranking list — not just within top-k but near the top.

**Use case:** Common in IR (information retrieval) and vector search evaluation when ranking quality matters.

---

#### 📈 2. **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)**

**Definition:**
Considers not just binary relevance (hit/miss) but also *graded* relevance (e.g., true rank distance).

```
DCG@k = Σ(i=1 to k) (2^rel_i - 1) / log₂(i + 1)
NDCG@k = DCG@k / IDCG@k
```

Here, a relevant item appearing at rank 2 contributes less than at rank 1 due to the logarithmic discount. If your true neighbors are far down (e.g., rank 100,000), their contribution will be near zero.

**Use case:** Standard metric in ranking and recommendation systems — measures how *well ordered* your retrieved results are.

---

#### 📊 3. **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**

**Definition:**
Measures how soon the *first* relevant item appears in the ranked list:

```
MRR = (1 / N) * Σ(i=1 to N) (1 / rank_i)
```

Useful when you mostly care about whether at least one good match is near the top.

---

#### 💡 4. **Rank-weighted Recall or Recall@R**

Some papers also compute recall not just for the top-k results, but for *different depth thresholds* (e.g., recall@10, recall@100, recall@1000).
Plotting this as a curve helps visualize how far the true neighbors are distributed.

**Benefits:** 
- More comprehensive evaluation of search quality
- Ranking-aware metrics (MAP, NDCG, MRR) complement recall
- Better understanding of result quality at different depth thresholds
- Industry-standard metrics for comparison with other systems

**Implementation:** Add these metrics alongside existing recall calculations, with options to enable/disable specific metrics and export results to CSV for analysis.

## Wrapper Scripts Enhancements

### 0. ~~Implement infrastructure for wrappers as described in WRAPPERS.md~~
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Description:** Established the foundational infrastructure to support the development and integration of various wrapper scripts as outlined in WRAPPERS.md.  

**Implementation:** Created Python-based wrapper framework following KIS (Keep It Simple) principles:
- **bench/wrappers/base_wrapper.py**: Single-file core framework (~580 lines) with `ValKeyBenchmarkWrapper`, `BenchmarkConfig`, `BenchmarkResult` classes
- **Search algorithms**: `binary_search_max_qps()`, `grid_search()`, `find_max_qps_with_constraints()`
- **Stage signaling**: Simple context manager emits `[STAGE:START/END]` signals to stderr for external monitoring tools
- **Auto-detection**: Binary location, cluster mode detection
- **Result parsing**: Console output and CSV export
- **Example scripts**: `max_qps_recall.py` (Wrapper #1 implementation), `stage-monitor.sh` (external monitoring demo)

**Design Decisions:**
- Leverage C binary's config persistence, cluster handling, and stage signaling (TODO #5)
- No separate ConfigManager, ClusterManager, or StageManager modules - kept in base class
- External tools parse stage signals rather than embedded perf collection
- All core logic in single file for maintainability

**Benefits:** Clean, maintainable foundation for all future wrapper implementations. Ready for Wrappers #2-6.

**Documentation:** See `bench/wrappers/README.md` for full API reference and usage examples.

### 2. ~~Max QPS at Recall and Latency Thresholds~~
**Status:** ✅ Completed (via infrastructure)  
**Description:** Add wrapper to find maximum QPS while maintaining both recall and latency thresholds.  
**Implementation:** `ValKeyBenchmarkWrapper.find_max_qps_with_constraints()` method and available in `max_qps_recall.py` via `--max-p99-latency` flag.  
**Benefits:** More realistic performance testing with SLA constraints.

### 3. ~~Optimal Configuration Discovery~~
**Status:** ✅ Completed (via infrastructure)  
**Description:** Add wrapper to find optimal thread and client count configurations.  
**Implementation:** `ValKeyBenchmarkWrapper.grid_search()` method with filtering support.  
**Benefits:** Automated tuning for specific hardware and workload combinations.

### 4. ~~Profiling Integration with Test Stages~~
**Status:** ✅ Completed (via infrastructure)  
**Description:** Use `test stage` and `test tag` to trigger data collectors while in specific stages and tag the output accordingly.  
**Implementation:** `bench/scripts/stage-monitor.sh` - External bash script that monitors `[STAGE:START/END]` signals and triggers perf collection during specified stages.  
**Benefits:** Automated profiling workflow with properly labeled data.

### 5. Memory Saturation Testing
**Status:** Planned
**Description:** Wrapper for testing with 100% memory utilization.  
**Benefits:** Test behavior under memory pressure and eviction scenarios.

### 6. Payload Impact Testing
**Status:** Planned
**Description:** Add wrapper to test the impact of different payload sizes and types.  
**Benefits:** Understand memory and performance tradeoffs with different metadata configurations.
